# Server:
Server version of Weave will require the player to call the StartServer function within a player join event. This is where the main 

Weave should be loaded as follows: Run builder for preempt features -> Load Weave settings -> Load selected middleware -> Load Handlers -> Load Data Models. Data models that are linked within handlers will be the first to be loaded.
